# Exploratory-Deep-Learning


This project explores the use of machine learning to predict the ending strengths of each rank in the military branches for the following year. A survey is given to people in each branch every year with a series of questions asking about their experience with different aspects in their daily work. This data is paired with the ending strengths (number of people in each position in each branch)to measure the satisfaction of individuals against the numbr of people that chose to stay in for the following year. 
The LSTM model allows us to measure the key fetures over time across each grade to predict the number of people the next year.
